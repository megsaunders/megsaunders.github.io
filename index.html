        <p>
            My research focuses on the effects of environmental factors, human stressors, and management actions 
            on marine ecosystems.  
        </p>
        <p> 

            I employ a combination of modelling, field and laboratory approaches in my research, which I use to help
            identify management and policy recommendations to mitigate negative impacts of human stressors on marine ecosystems. 
            My research has been funded in part through a number of competitive fellowships and awards.
        </p>
        <p> 

            Interdisciplinary collaborations are a foundation of my research program, and to this end I work closely with
            ecologists, engineers, economists, geographers, conservation planners and lawyers.
        </p>
        <p> 
            I communicate science in peer-reviewed publications, presentions, social media, traditional media, 
            and short videos.
